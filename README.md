# JojaMart_catalogue_prediction
I build a supervised machine learning model data pipeline for predicting which products JojaMart will discontinue next catalogue update.

## JojaMart's problem statement:
JojaMart regularly updates its product catalogue in their Stardew branch. 
To improve the efficiency of inventory management when they update their catalogue, they would like a model to predict which items will be discontinued the next time the catalogue is updated (which occurs every 6 months).
